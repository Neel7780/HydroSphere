Critical Updates Needed for Problem Statement Alignment
1. Green Hydrogen Infrastructure Focus
Your current features are too generic. You need:
// Hydrogen-specific infrastructure mapping
// app/api/hydrogen/infrastructure/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    infrastructure: [
      {
        type: 'electrolysis_plant',
        locations: await getElectrolysisPlantLocations(),
        capacity: 'Total: 500 MW',
        efficiency: '85%'
      },
      {
        type: 'hydrogen_storage',
        locations: await getStorageLocations(),
        capacity: 'Total: 1000 tons',
        technology: 'Compressed + Liquid'
      },
      {
        type: 'distribution_network',
        routes: await getDistributionRoutes(),
        coverage: '80% of industrial clusters'
      }
    ]
  });
}
2. India-Specific Data Integration
// India-specific renewable energy data
// app/api/india/renewable/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    solar_potential: {
      rajasthan: { irradiance: '5.5 kWh/m¬≤/day', potential: '200 GW' },
      gujarat: { irradiance: '5.2 kWh/m¬≤/day', potential: '150 GW' },
      madhya_pradesh: { irradiance: '5.0 kWh/m¬≤/day', potential: '120 GW' }
    },
    wind_potential: {
      tamil_nadu: { speed: '7.5 m/s', potential: '100 GW' },
      gujarat: { speed: '6.8 m/s', potential: '80 GW' }
    }
  });
}
// Policy impact analysis
// app/api/policy/impact/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { policy_type, location, investment_amount } = await request.json();
  
  // Calculate policy impact on hydrogen hub development
  const impact = await calculatePolicyImpact({
    policy: policy_type, // 'subsidy', 'tax_benefit', 'infrastructure_support'
    location: location,
    investment: investment_amount,
    timeline: '5 years'
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, impact });
}
Feature Modifications Needed:
Current Features ‚Üí Enhanced for Hydrogen Focus:
Map Dashboard: Add hydrogen infrastructure layers, electrolysis plant locations, storage facilities
City Ranking: Include hydrogen production potential, green energy availability, policy support
Scenario Simulator: Add hydrogen demand forecasting, infrastructure cost modeling, policy scenario testing
Bottom Line: Your current features are a good foundation but need significant enhancement to meet your hackathon requirements. The focus should shift from generic city analysis to hydrogen-specific infrastructure optimization for India.
